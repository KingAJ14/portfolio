        <div class="child2"> This project was a very open project and I enjoyed taking it my own direction. Our only instruction for this project was to create some sort of bacteria. I decided to make bacteria that eat food and each other to grow. The most challenging part of this project was checking the position of the bacteria against each other. I really enjoyed this project since I discovered PVectors and researched them quite a bit.
