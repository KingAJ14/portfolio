   <div class="box"> My name is Adam king and I am a Senior at Rosemount High School. I am currently in my second year of computer science classes after taking AP computer science A last year. </div>
     <div class="box"> Outside of school, my hobbies include mainly playing sports, hanging out with friends and playing video games. I’ve played some form of football ever since I was in third grade and it has been a huge part of shaping me into who I am today. The values of hard work, dedication and teamwork I’ve learned from football have grown into some of my core values. Since I started playing video games a few years ago I’ve been even more intrigued with technology. I’m fascinated with how games are created and computer science has shown me some of that.</div>
     <div class="box"> I plan to attend a four year university after high school. My top choice for college is the University of St. Thomas as my family has a lot of relation to that school. I plan to study in the STEM field. I am thinking about some form of engineering or a technological related career. I enjoy the unique aspects of computer science of tough problem solving paired with creativity and freedom.
