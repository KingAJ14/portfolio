<div class="box"> The first project I did last year was my holiday card. At that point I found coding somewhat confusing. The piece of code I struggled with most on that project was getting the snow to fall at a speed and pattern I wanted. Overall I was very proud of that project and was glad I could show my family something visually pleasing. After doing mostly problem solving lab up to that point in the year, I really liked having some freedom. My favorite part was that it was such a visual project instead of just code running correctly on a screen.

    <div class="box">   My second project, at the end of last school year, was my own version of flappy bird. Again I enjoyed this project a lot because it gave visual feedback and allowed for freedom and creativity. The things I struggled with most on that project were having detection when the bird hit a pipe and also generating the pipes themselves. I’m not totally pleased with the final project, but I think looking back that my crappy flappy bird will be one of my biggest growing and learning moments in computer science. I hope to look back on this project in the future and see how far I’ve come.
